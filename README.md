# TableauProject_SampleSuperstore

In this Tableau Project, we analyse Sample Superstore dataset. We make use of some basic charts like Pie chart, Bar chart, Heat table, Highlight table, Map, and several advanced charts such as Dual axis chart, Blended axis chart, Lollipop chart, Donut chart and Funnel chart. We also use Calculated fields, Filters, Ranking and Forecasting.

Note: In order to open the .twbx file, you will need access to Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader.
